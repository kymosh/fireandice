Basin Characterization Model data for California downloaded from: 
http://climate.calcommons.org/dataset/2014-CA-BCM
NOTE: This website periodically goes offline/can be really slow to connect. 
Data downloaded March 2021 by GRC. Folders are first broken down by climate 
variable, then by time period (either historic normals or projected years). In the projected years folder,
data is broken into RCPs. Each RCP folder contains a handful of different models, and one raster called "mean"
which is the average of all the models for that RCP+year combo.

This data was processed June through July 20201 by Gina Cova.
Folders contain RBR (with offset) and RdNBR (with offset) images for every fire over 4 ha in 
CALFIRE's FRAP dataset that burned between 1985 through the end of 2020.
Burn severity images were derived using Sean Park's Google Earth Engine scripts. 1985 through 2019
fires use Landsat imagery; 2020 fires use Sentinel.
